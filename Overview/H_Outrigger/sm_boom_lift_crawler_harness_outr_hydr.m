%% Boom Lift Crawler Outrigger with Hydraulic Actuation (Test Harness)
%
% This example models the hydraulic actuation system for one outrigger of a
% boom lift. A double-acting cylinder extends or contracts to raise and
% lower the chassis.  Pilot-operated check valves lock the cylinder in
% place. In the boom lift, four outriggers move independently to keep the
% boom level and to distribute the load.
%
% This model is a test harness from the main model (see
% <matlab:web('sm_boom_lift_crawler.html'); documentation>).

%% Component Under Test
%
% The component under test is a hydraulic actuation system for the
% outriggers of a boom lift. A double-acting cylinder with three pilot
% check valves extends to lower the outrigger. The pilot check valves lock
% the cylinder in place when the 4-way valve returns to center, even if a
% hose upstream bursts so the outriggers donâ€™t collapse. Two pilot check
% valves are on the extend side of the cylinder in case one fails while the
% system is in use.

%% Simulation Results: Chassis Sequence
%%
%
% The plots below shows the result of a test sequence that extends and
% retracts all actuators in the chassis (outriggers and tracks).  The test
% sequence includes signals for all valves so that the test sequence can
% also be run on the full model.
