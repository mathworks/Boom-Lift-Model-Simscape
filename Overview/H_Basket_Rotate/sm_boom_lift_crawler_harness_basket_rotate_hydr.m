%% Basket Rotation with Hydraulic Actuation (Test Harness)
%
% This example models the hydraulic actuator to orient a boom lift basket.
% A double-acting rotational actuator rotates the basket into position.
% Counterbalance valves ensure the system stays locked in place.
%
% This model is a test harness from the main model (see
% <matlab:web('sm_boom_lift_crawler.html'); documentation>).

%% Component Under Test
%
% The component under test is a hydraulic rotary actuator.  The hydraulic
% network contains a four-way valve to control the rotation direction and
% two counterbalance valves. The counterbalance valves lock the actuator in
% place when the 4-way valve returns to center. The lock persists if
% pressure upstream drops so the basket doesnâ€™t begin to drift while the
% crew is still at work.

%% Simulation Results: Basket Rotate Sequence
%%
%
% The plots below shows the result of a test sequence designed to actuate
% only the rotational actuator for the basket.  The test sequence includes
% signals for all valves so that the test sequence can also be run on the
% full model.
