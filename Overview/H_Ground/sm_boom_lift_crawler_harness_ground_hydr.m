%% Boom Lift Crawler Chassis with Hydraulic Actuation (Test Harness)
%
% This example models the hydraulic actuation system for the chassis of a
% boom lift.  Four actuators extend and contract to position the
% outriggers, and two other actuators control the separation of the two
% tracks.  This model is used to examine the hydraulic system.
%
% This model is a test harness from the main model (see
% <matlab:web('sm_boom_lift_crawler.html'); documentation>).

%% Component Under Test
%
% The component under test is a hydraulic actuation system for the chassis
% of a boom lift. This includes the outriggers and track extension
% actuators. 
%

open_system([bdroot '/Ground Manifold'],'force');
%%
%
% Double-acting cylinders with three pilot check valves extend to lower the
% outrigger. The pilot check valves lock the cylinder in place when the
% 4-way valve returns to center, even if a hose upstream bursts so the
% outriggers donâ€™t collapse. Two pilot check valves are on the extend side
% of the cylinder in case one fails while the system is in use.

open_system([bdroot '/Ground Manifold/Ground Valve Block Right'],'force');

%%
%
% The track actuation system inculudes a four-way valve that determines if
% the track separation increases or decreases. There are no valves to lock
% the cylinders mid-stroke.

open_system([bdroot '/Ground Manifold/Ground Valve Block Left'],'force');

%% Simulation Results: Chassis Sequence
%%
%
% The plots below shows the result of a test sequence that extends and
% retracts all actuators in the chassis (outriggers and tracks).  The test
% sequence includes signals for all valves so that the test sequence can
% also be run on the full model.
